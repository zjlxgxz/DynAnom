# Codebase for _[Subset Node Anomaly Tracking over Large Dynamic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09786)_ @KDD-2022
## Authors: _[Xingzhi Guo](https://zjlxgxz.github.io/zjlxgxz/), [Baojian Zhou](https://baojian.github.io) and [Steven Skiena](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~skiena/)_

## 1. Download data:
Download the compiled Person-Event Graph, and unzip them into the folder toy-data
- Person-Event Graph Link:
```
 https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nu-2Lx80WGD9I7cjXZ1H1SKauTr_UIe7?usp=sharing
```
## 2. Set up env

```
sh ./recipe/setup.sh
```
##### Notes  1. Due to weiredness of Numba, a specific python version (3.7) is needed: #SEE: https://github.com/numba/numba/issues/5156
##### Notes  2. That is a weighted version of DynamicPPE  


## 2. Run the method (all experiments)
```
sh ./recipe/run.sh
```

## 3. Output figure/results:
Once get all results in ``` ./output ```
Run all cells in:
```
./src/visualize.ipynb
```
The figures/results should be reproduced. Cheers! 


## 4. Please kindly support us by citing the following papers:
